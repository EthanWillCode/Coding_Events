# Coding_Events

  Welcome to Coding_Events. We are building an app that will give anyone with an interest in coding a digital space to find physical spaces
  to interact with other like-minded individuals.
  
  This app is currently in development. As it stands anyone can add an event by providing: the name, a contact email, brief description,
  and by selecting an event category from a list.
  Anyone can also create an event category.
  After the event is created anyone can also add tags to the event.
  
  In the future I would like to implement a user class.
    It should give these functionalities:
      -give ownership to created events so that only the person who created it can edit it.
      -allow other users to sign up for events.
    It should have a few fields:
      -name
      -password
      -bio <optional>
  
  I would also at some point like to add time and place fields so that people know when and where this is before they signup.
